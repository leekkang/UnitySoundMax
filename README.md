# UnitySoundMax

* This program was provided as a result of the Capstone project.
  It is clear that some of the codes are still used for the [Unnamed SDVX clone](https://github.com/Drewol/unnamed-sdvx-clone), so it should be considered.

* This program was created using Unity3d 2018.3.9f1.
* NGUI, All Effects, [EasingFucntion](https://gist.github.com/cjddmut/d789b9eb78216998e95c) is not available as a 3rd party.
