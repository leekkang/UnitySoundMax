# UnitySoundMax

* This program was provided as a result of the Capstone project.
  It is clear that some of the codes are still used for the [Unnamed SDVX clone](https://github.com/Drewol/unnamed-sdvx-clone), so it should be considered.

* This program is an launcher that reads the `ksh` file and helps you enjoy the game in the same way as [SDVX](https://remywiki.com/What_is_SOUND_VOLTEX) and [KShootMania](https://www.kshootmania.com/)
* This program was created using Unity3d 2018.3.9f1.
