# UnitySoundMax

* This program was provided as a result of the Capstone project.
  It is clear that some of the codes are still used for the [Unnamed SDVX clone](https://github.com/Drewol/unnamed-sdvx-clone), so it should be considered.

* This program is an launcher that reads the `KShoot charts(*.ksh)` file and helps you enjoy the game in the same way as [SDVX](https://remywiki.com/What_is_SOUND_VOLTEX) and [KShootMania](https://www.kshootmania.com/)
* This program was created using Unity3d 2018.3.9f1.
* NGUI, All Effects, [EasingFucntion](https://gist.github.com/cjddmut/d789b9eb78216998e95c) is not available as a 3rd party.

## Usage

* It is recommended to use [Unnamed SDVX clone](https://github.com/Drewol/unnamed-sdvx-clone) for general gameplay.
  * The project has many experimental elements.
  * Since the music load time optimization and caching were not done at all, it takes an extremely long time to run.
  * Nevertheless, if you want to use the program, please refer to the instructions below.
* If you build this Unity Project successfully, You can see the folder named `SoundMax_Data` inside the folder that contains the `.exe extension` file.
* The folder include `ksh extension` files must be located in the `SoundMax_Data/StreamingAssets/Music` folder.
  * `BuildFolder/SoundMax_Data/StreamingAssets/Music/KSHFolder`
* When the exe file is executed, the files located in the above path are read and displayed in the music select menu.
